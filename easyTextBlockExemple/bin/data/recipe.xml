Use 120g of pesto for the pasta for two.[BR][BR][TITLE]To make the pesto:[ENDTITLE][BR]Pick the basil leaves. Wash them gently only if you have to (let them dry naturally, spread out on a cloth). Crush the garlic to a paste with a little salt. Put the cheeses, basil and garlic into a food processor and work until a fine paste, then add the pine nuts and continue until quite fine, but with some texture from the kernels. Add the olive oil and butter, some salt and pepper.It is best to let it stand for a few minutes before you finally taste for seasoning.[BR][BR][TITLE]To make the pasta:[ENDTITLE][BR]Put the semola out on a wooden board, make a well and add 75ml water at room temperature. Bring together to make a firm dough, knead and leave to rest, covered, for at least 15 minutes. Make sure your board is completely free of any flour. Break off a walnut-sized lump of dough and roll to make a long, 3mm wide strand. Cut into 3-4cm lengths. There are two ways to proceed from here.</pasta_recipe>

<pasta_recipe>CONIGLIO ALL'ISCHITANA[BR]Heat the oil in a very wide pan (40cm - you need space to brown the rabbit, although this can be done in two batches in a smaller pan). Fry the garlic with the chilli until the cloves begin to brown, remove with a slotted spoon and set aside. Add the rabbit, seasoned with salt and pepper, and brown very well over a medium heat - this will take a good 15 minutes if the heat isn't too high. Return the garlic and chilli and add the wine. Allow to bubble slowly, uncovered, turning the rabbit every 5 minutes or so. After half an hour, when almost all the wine has evaporated, add the tomato and parsley and season to taste. Continue to cook over the same heat, still turning the rabbit every few minutes for longer than you might think.[BR][BR]This sauce is cooked until it is incredibly reduced, and the rabbit is coated in a concentrated paste of tomato in which it again starts to fry.  This should take about 40 minutes from when you add the tomatoes, but keep on going until you are afraid the tomato might burn. Put the pasta on at this point.[BR][BR]There will appear to be almost no sauce for your pasta, but adding 200ml of water will rejuvenate and extend the meagre scrapings that stick to pan and rabbit. Remove the meat (keep it somewhere warm for your second course), and add the pasta (drained and al dente) to the pan and cook for a minute in the sauce. Serve as is, or with a little pecorino if you like.</pasta_recipe>
